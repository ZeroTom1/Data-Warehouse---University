# Data-Warehouse-University

The university's primary objective is to generate and disseminate knowledge. To realize this, the president anticipates a yearly 5% growth in publications and a minimum 80% pass rate in studies. The rector oversees two key indicators: monthly publication numbers and semester-wise student enrollment per major. Success is defined by a monthly publication increase of at least 0.5%, barring holidays, and a maximum 2% decline in student enrollment per major each semester (except the first year, where up to 5% is acceptable). Currently, the challenge lies in identifying factors influencing student retention and addressing the implementation of COVID restrictions strategy.
